# how does jsp work

JSPs compile to Servlets. They just have a special compiler that is typically embedded in the container.

From good ole wikipedia:

Architecturally, JSP may be viewed as a high-level abstraction of Java servlets. JSPs are translated into servlets at runtime; each JSP's servlet is cached and re-used until the original JSP is modified.
